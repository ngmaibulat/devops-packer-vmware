### AWS

Create and set up an EC2 instance on AWS.
Create an AMI from your EC2 instance.
Use the EC2 CLI command aws ec2 create-instance-export-task to export the instance to an S3 bucket. The instance will be exported in OVA format, which is compatible with VMware.
Download the OVA file from your S3 bucket to your local system.
Use the vSphere Client to import the OVA file into your VMware environment.

### Azure

Similarly, for Microsoft Azure, you can create a Virtual Machine, capture it as an image, then convert it into a VHD file. Once you have the VHD file, you can convert it into a VMDK file (the disk format that VMware uses) using a tool such as qemu-img. However, please note that these steps can be complex and error-prone.

### GCP

Create and set up a VM instance on GCP.
Stop the instance when you are ready to capture the image.
Use the gcloud compute images create command to create an image from the disk of the VM.
Once you have the image, there is no direct way to export it to a VMware-compatible format within GCP. You can, however, export the image to a raw format or VHD format:

Use the gcloud compute images export command to export the image to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
Then, download the image file from the storage bucket to your local system.
At this point, you will have a disk image file in a raw or VHD format, and you can use a tool like qemu-img to convert it to a VMDK file, which can be used with VMware:

```
qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk input.raw output.vmdk
qemu-img convert -f vpc -O vmdk input.vhd output.vmdk
```
